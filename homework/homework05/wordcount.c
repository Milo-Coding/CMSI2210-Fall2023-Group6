/*
 * Write a C program wordcount.c that counts the number of words in a file of text.
 * Your program should take a file name as a command line argument. As you read the
 * file contents, keep a count of the number of words which are separated by
 * "whitespace". [Research what is meant by "whitespace" in the C environment.] When
 * the file has been completely read, close the file and write out the number of
 * words. Be sure you handle error conditions like files that don't exist or errors
 * while reading the file. You should also be able to handle files that are in
 * different directories from where your program resides
